# gnucash-python
Some simple Python script in order to add some command line sugar for automation purposes.

Acutally: just one [save-as](https://github.com/rotdrop/gnucash-python/blob/main/src/save-as.py) script which also only works with the following two PRs applied to GnuCash:

- https://github.com/Gnucash/gnucash/pull/2090
- https://github.com/Gnucash/gnucash/pull/2091
